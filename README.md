This project allows the user to guess the right number between 1 and 10.
The user has 3 guesses,
	when the user guesses correctly, they are prompted to "Play Again" if they want.
	when the user guesses incorrectly, they will get a chance to play until their 3 guesses run out.
	If all their lives run out, they will have a chance to "Play Again".
