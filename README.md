# Number Guess Game
This project allows the user to guess the right number between 1 and 10.
The user has 3 guesses,
	when the user guesses correctly, they are prompted to "Play Again" if they want.
	when the user guesses incorrectly, they will get a chance to play until their 3 guesses run out.
	If all their lives run out, they will have a chance to "Play Again".

This game is coded with html,css, and javascript. The css is mainly bootstrap for the cleaner look, and also overall responsiveness.

Please have a look at my code, if you see something that could be improved or corrected, send me a pull request anytime and ill have a look at it!
